# Security Policy

## Supported versions

AuraSpeak is in **pre-alpha**. There are no stable releases yet. We do our best to address critical security issues in the current development line (default branch). We do not officially support older versions.

## How to report a vulnerability

**Report privately** using GitHub Security Advisories:

1. Open the **Security** tab of the affected repo (or the main repo [AuraSpeak/auraspeak](https://github.com/AuraSpeak/auraspeak)).
2. Click **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**.

Your report stays private until a fix is ready. Private vulnerability reporting must be enabled in the repo (Settings → Code security and analysis). If it is not available in a given repo, report via the main repo [AuraSpeak/auraspeak](https://github.com/AuraSpeak/auraspeak).

## What to expect

- We will acknowledge your report (usually within a few days).
- We will assess the issue and, if applicable, work on a fix. Timing depends on severity and effort; we will update you when useful.
- We will coordinate disclosure (e.g. fix and advisory) with you before making details public.

## No bounty

We do not run a bug bounty program. AuraSpeak is a small, pre-alpha project. We appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Hall of thanks

We are happy to thank researchers who help us fix security issues, on request (e.g. in release notes or in this file).
